    There is but one truly serious <span class="secret">philosophical</span> problem, and that
is <span class="secret">suicide</span>. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to
answering the <span class="secret">fundamental</span> question of philosophy.
    All the rest—
whether or not the world has <span class="secret">three dimensions</span>, whether the mind
has nine or twelve categories—comes afterwards. These are
games; one must first answer.
    And if it is true, as <span class="secret">Nietzsche claims</span>,
that a <span class="secret">philosopher</span>, to deserve our <span class="secret">respect</span>, must preach by example,
you can appreciate the importance of that reply, for it will <span class="secret">precede</span>
the <span class="secret">definitive</span> act.
These are <span class="secret">facts</span> the <span class="secret">heart</span> can feel; yet they call
for careful study before they become clear to the <span class="secret">intellect</span>.

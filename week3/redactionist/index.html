  <p>Lorem Ipsum is <span class="redacted">simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</span> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <span class="secret">1500s</span>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type <span class="secret">specimen book.</span> </p>
  <p>It has survived not only five centuries, <span class="secret">but also the leap</span> into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <span class="redacted">It was popularised in the 1960s with the release</span></p>
  <p><span class="redacted">Letraset sheets</span> containing <span class="secret">Lorem Ipsum</span> passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
  <p>Contrary to popular belief, <span class="redacted">Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.</span> It has roots in a piece of classical <span class="secret">Latin literature</span> from 45 BC, making it over <span class="secret">2000 years old.</span></p>

  <p>Lorem Ipsum is <span class="redacted">simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</span> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>
  <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <span class="redacted">It was popularised in the 1960s with the release</span></p>
  <p><span class="redacted">Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing</span> software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
  <p>Contrary to popular belief, <span class="redacted">Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.</span> It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.</p>
